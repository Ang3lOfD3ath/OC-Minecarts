## Network Rail Controller

![A Block](block:ocminecart:networkrailbase@5)

Works like a normal Cable, except on the up side.
On the top side no cables can connect, but [Networkrails](block/netrail.md) can.

In the GUI you can set the connection type and a camouflage block for the top side.

##### Connection Types:
- Network:             Act like a switch.
- Power:               Charge cart.
- Network + Power:  Do both.

You can only put normal rendered, opaque blocks in the camoslot.

Right-Click on a locomotive / cart with an [remote module](remote.md) intalled to get more information about it.
CTRL + Sneak + Right-Click to copy the address to your clipboard.

#### The config GUI
A left-click on a locomotive / cart with an remote module analyzer will open a config gui.

The Button "Remove Module" will uninstall the remote module from the cart.

With the "U" or "L" button you can lock the module so that only the owner and an admin can access it. 

The "Change Password" option is for a feature I will add later. 

Only the owner and an admin can lock the gui and set a password.

# Computer Cart
![You can't sit in it :(](item:ocminecart:itemcomputercart@0)
You create a computer cart by placing a [computer cart case](cartcase.md). in an [assembler](/%LANGUAGE%/block/assembler.md).

Like normal minecarts, computer carts can only be placed on rails.
They can also be placed by a dispenser.

Computer carts cannot connect to external components and they can't break or place blocks.
But they can send messages via cable if the cart stands on a [networkrail](../block/netrail.md)


If you break the cart, it drops the inventory of the cart and a computer cart will keep its internal components.
